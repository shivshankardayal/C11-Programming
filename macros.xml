    <d:title>Preprocessing Directives</d:title>
    <d:para>The following comes from section 6.10 of specification. It will
    terminate when you see code starting. :-)</d:para>
    <d:para>A <d:emphasis role="italic">preprocessing directive</d:emphasis>
    consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens that begins with a
    <d:code>#</d:code> preprocessing token that (at the start of translation
    phase 4) is either the first character in the source file (optionally after
    white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows white space
    containing at least one new-line character, and is ended by the next
    new-line character.<d:footnote><d:para>Thus, preprocessing directives are
    commonly called “lines”. These “lines” have no other syntactic
    significance, as all white space is equivalent except in certain situations
    during preprocessing (see the # character string literal creation operator
    in 12.3.2, for example).</d:para></d:footnote> A new-line character ends
    the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what would otherwise
    be an invocation of a function-like macro.</d:para>
    <d:para>A text line shall not begin with a <d:code>#</d:code> preprocessing
    token. A non-directive shall not begin with any of the directive names
    appearing in the syntax.</d:para>
    <d:para>When in a group that is skipped (12.1), the directive syntax is
    relaxed to allow any sequence of preprocessing tokens to occur between the
    directive name and the following new-line character.</d:para>
