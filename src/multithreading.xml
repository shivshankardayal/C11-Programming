  <d:title>Multi-threaded Programming</d:title>
  <d:para>
    Even though it has been some time since C11 specification has been
    published and multi-threaded programming is now supported by language
    specification <d:code>gcc</d:code> does not support it yet because of
    dependency problems with <d:code>glib</d:code>. I do not think it will come
    soon but eventually it will be implemented. Till then we have to wait.
