    terminate when you see code starting. :-)</p><p>A <span class="italic">preprocessing directive</span>
    consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens that begins with a
    <code class="code">#</code> preprocessing token that (at the start of translation
    phase 4) is either the first character in the source file (optionally after
    white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows white space
    containing at least one new-line character, and is ended by the next
    new-line character.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idp3605408" name="idp3605408">128</a>]</sup> A new-line character ends
    the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what would otherwise
    be an invocation of a function-like macro.</p><p>A text line shall not begin with a <code class="code">#</code> preprocessing
    token. A non-directive shall not begin with any of the directive names
    appearing in the syntax.</p><p>When in a group that is skipped (12.1), the directive syntax is
    relaxed to allow any sequence of preprocessing tokens to occur between the
    directive name and the following new-line character.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Constraints</strong></span></p><p>The only white-space characters that shall appear between
    preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive (from just after the
    introducing # preprocessing token through just before the terminating
    new-line character) are space and horizontal-tab (including spaces that
    have replaced comments or possibly other white-space characters in
    translation phase 3).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Semantics</strong></span></p><p>The implementation can process and skip sections of source files
    conditionally, include other source files, and replace macros. These
    capabilities are called preprocessing, because conceptually they occur
    before translation of the resulting translation unit.</p><p>The preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive are not
    subject to macro expansion unless otherwise stated.</p><p>EXAMPLE In:</p><pre class="CLexer"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#define EMPTY</span>
<span class="n">EMPTY</span> <span class="err">#</span> <span class="n">include</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</pre><p>the sequence of preprocessing tokens on the second line is not a
preprocessing directive, because it does not begin with a <code class="code">#</code> at
the start of translation phase 4, even though it will do so after the macro
<code class="code">EMPTY</code> has been replaced.</p><div class="sect1" title="12.1. Conditional Inclusion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp3614576"></a>12.1. Conditional Inclusion</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Constraints</strong></span></p><p>The expression that controls conditional inclusion shall be an
  integer constant expression except that: it shall not contain a cast;
  identifiers (including those lexically identical to keywords) are interpreted
  as described below; <sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idp3616672" name="idp3616672">129</a>]</sup> and it may contain unary operator
  expressions of the form:</p><pre class="screen">defined identifier</pre><p>or:</p><pre class="screen">defined (identifier)</pre><p>which evaluate to 1 if the identifier is currently defined as a macro
  name (that is, if it is predefined or if it has been the subject of a
  <code class="code">#define</code> preprocessing directive without an intervening
  <code class="code">#undef</code> directive with the same subject identifier), 0 if it
  is not.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Sematics</strong></span></p><p>Preprocessing directives of the forms:</p><pre class="CLexer"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># if constant-expression new-line group_opt</span>

</pre></div>
</pre><p>check whether the controlling constant expression evaluates to
nonzero.</p><p>Prior to evaluation, macro invocations in the list of preprocessing
tokens that will become the controlling constant expression are replaced
(except for those macro names modified by the defined unary operator), just as
in normal text. If the token defined is generated as a result of this
replacement process or use of the defined unary operator does not match one of
the two specified forms prior to macro replacement, the behavior is
undefined. After all replacements due to macro expansion and the defined unary
operator have been performed, all remaining identifiers are replaced with the
pp-number 0, and then each preprocessing token is converted into a token. The
resulting tokens compose the controlling constant expression which is evaluated
according to the rules of constant expressions. For the purposes of this token
conversion and evaluation, all signed integer types and all unsigned integer
types act as if they hav e the same representation as, respectively, the types
<code class="code">intmax_t</code> and <code class="code">uintmax_t</code> defined in the header
<code class="code"><stdint.h></code>.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idp3500256" name="idp3500256">130</a>]</sup> This includes interpreting character constants, which
may involve converting escape sequences into execution character set
members. Whether the numeric value for these character constants matches the
value obtained when an identical character constant occurs in an expression
(other than within a <code class="code">#if</code> or <code class="code">#elif</code> directive)
is implementation-defined.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idp3504640" name="idp3504640">131</a>]</sup> Also, whether a
single-character character constant may have a negative value is
implementation-defined.</p><p>Preprocessing directives of the forms:</p><pre class="CLexer"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># ifdef identifier new-line group_opt</span>

</pre><p>check whether the identifier is or is not currently defined as a macro
name. Their conditions are equivalent to <code class="code">#if</code> defined
identifier and <code class="code">#if !defined</code> identifier respectively.</p><p>Each directive’s condition is checked in order. If it evaluates to
false (zero), the group that it controls is skipped: directives are processed
only through the name that determines the directive in order to keep track of
the level of nested conditionals; the rest of the directives’ preprocessing
tokens are ignored, as are the other preprocessing tokens in the group. Only
the first group whose control condition evaluates to true (nonzero) is
processed. If none of the conditions evaluates to true, and there is a #else
directive, the group controlled by the #else is processed; lacking a #else
directive, all the groups until the #endif are skipped.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.idp3510176" name="idp3510176">132</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect1" title="12.2. Source File Inclusion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp3511136"></a>12.2. Source File Inclusion</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Constraints</strong></span></p><p>A <code class="code">#include</code> directive shall identify a header or

all replacements shall match one of the two previous

matching parentheses forms the list of arguments for the function-like
macro. The individual arguments within the list are separated by comma
preprocessing tokens, but comma preprocessing tokens between matching inner
parentheses do not separate arguments. If there are sequences of preprocessing
