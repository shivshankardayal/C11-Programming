    <d:para>The header <d:code>&amp;lt;stdio.h></d:code> declares three types,

    <d:para>The header <d:code>&amp;lt;wchar.h></d:code> declares a number of
    functions useful for wide character input and output. The wide character
    input/output functions described in that subclause provide operations
    analogous to most of those described here, except that the fundamental
    units internal to the program are wide characters. The external
    representation (in the file) is a sequence of "generalized" multibyte
    characters, as described further in Files.</d:para>
    <d:para>The input/output functions are given the following collective
    terms:</d:para>
    <d:itemizedlist>
      <d:listitem>
	<d:para>The <d:emphasis role="italic">wide character input
	functions</d:emphasis> - those functions described in Extended
	multibyte and wide character utilities &amp;lt;wchar.h> that perform

	fread, fscanf, fwrite, getc, getchar, gets, perror, printf, putc,
	putchar, puts, scanf, ungetc, vfprintf, vfscanf, vprintf</d:code> and
	<d:code>vscanf</d:code>.</d:para>

    </d:itemizedlist>
  </d:sect1>
  <d:sect1>
    <d:title>Streams</d:title>
    <d:para>Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as
    terminals and tape drives, or whether to or from files supported on
    structured storage devices, are mapped into logical data streams, whose
    properties are more uniform than their various inputs and outputs. Two
    forms of mapping are supported, for text streams and for binary
    streams.<d:footnote><d:para>An implementation need not distinguish between
    text streams and binary streams. In such an implementation, there need be
    no new-line characters in a text stream nor any limit to the length of a
    line.</d:para></d:footnote></d:para>
    <d:para>A text stream is an ordered sequence of characters composed into
    lines, each line consisting of zero or more characters plus a terminating
    new-line character. Whether the last line requires a terminating new-line
    character is implementation-defined. Characters may have to be added,
    altered, or deleted on input and output to conform to differing conventions
    for representing text in the host environment. Thus, there need not be a
    oneto- one correspondence between the characters in a stream and those in
    the external representation. Data read in from a text stream will
    necessarily compare equal to the data that were earlier written out to that
    stream only if: the data consist only of printing characters and the
    control characters horizontal tab and new-line; no new-line character is
    immediately preceded by space characters; and the last character is a
    new-line character. Whether space characters that are written out
    immediately before a new-line character appear when read in is
    implementation-defined.</d:para>
    <d:para>A binary stream is an ordered sequence of characters that can
    transparently record internal data. Data read in from a binary stream shall
    compare equal to the data that were earlier written out to that stream,
    under the same implementation. Such a stream may, however, hav e an
    implementation-defined number of null characters appended to the end of the
    stream.</d:para>
    <d:para>Each stream has an orientation. After a stream is associated with
    an external file, but before any operations are performed on it, the stream
    is without orientation. Once a wide character input/output function has
    been applied to a stream without orientation, the stream becomes a
    <d:emphasis role="italic">wide-oriented</d:emphasis> stream. Similarly,
    once a byte input/output function has been applied to a stream without
    orientation, the stream becomes a byte-oriented stream. Only a call to the
    <d:code>freopen</d:code> function or the fwide function can otherwise alter
    the orientation of a stream. (A successful call to <d:code>freopen</d:code>
    removes any orientation.)<d:footnote><d:para>The three predefined streams
    <d:code>stdin, stdout</d:code> and <d:code>stderr</d:code> are unoriented
    at program startup.</d:para></d:footnote></d:para>
    <d:para>Byte input/output functions shall not be applied to a wide-oriented
    stream and wide character input/output functions shall not be applied to a
    byte-oriented stream. The remaining stream operations do not affect, and
    are not affected by, a stream's orientation, except for the following
    additional restrictions:</d:para>
    <d:itemizedlist>
      <d:listitem>
	<d:para>Binary wide-oriented streams have the file-positioning
	restrictions ascribed to both text and binary streams.</d:para>
      </d:listitem>
      <d:listitem>
	<d:para>For wide-oriented streams, after a successful call to a
	file-positioning function that leaves the file position indicator prior
	to the end-of-file, a wide character output function can overwrite a
	partial multibyte character; any file contents beyond the byte(s)
	written are henceforth indeterminate.</d:para>
      </d:listitem>
    </d:itemizedlist>
    <d:para>Each wide-oriented stream has an associated
    <d:code>mbstate_t</d:code> object that stores the current parse state of
    the stream. A successful call to fgetpos stores a representation of the
    value of this mbstate_t object as part of the value of the
    <d:code>fpos_t</d:code> object. A later successful call to fsetpos using
    the same stored <d:code>fpos_t</d:code> value restores the value of the
    associated <d:code>mbstate_t</d:code> object as well as the position within
    the controlled stream.</d:para>
    <d:para><d:emphasis role="bold">Environmental limits</d:emphasis></d:para>
    <d:para>An implementation shall support text files with lines containing at
    least 254 characters, including the terminating new-line character. The
    value of the macro <d:code>BUFSIZ</d:code> shall be at least 256.</d:para>
  </d:sect1>
  <d:sect1>
    <d:title>Files</d:title>
    <d:para>A stream is associated with an external file (which may be a
    physical device) by opening a file, which may involve <d:emphasis
    role="italic">creating</d:emphasis> a new file. Creating an existing file
    causes its former contents to be discarded, if necessary. If a file can
    support positioning requests (such as a disk file, as opposed to a
    terminal), then a file position indicator associated with the stream is
    positioned at the start (character number zero) of the file, unless the
    file is opened with append mode in which case it is implementation-defined
    whether the file <d:emphasis role="italic">position</d:emphasis> indicator
    is initially positioned at the beginning or the end of the file. The file
    position indicator is maintained by subsequent reads, writes, and
    positioning requests, to facilitate an orderly progression through the
    file.</d:para>
    <d:para>Binary files are not truncated, except as defined in The fopen
    function. Whether a write on a text stream causes the associated file to be
    truncated beyond that point is implementation-defined.</d:para>
    <d:para>When a stream is <d:emphasis role="italic">unbuffered</d:emphasis>,
    characters are intended to appear from the source or at the destination as
    soon as possible. Otherwise characters may be accumulated and transmitted
    to or from the host environment as a block. When a stream is <d:emphasis
    role="italic">fully buffered</d:emphasis>, characters are intended to be 
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a buffer is 
    filled. When a stream is <d:emphasis role="italic">line
    buffered</d:emphasis>, characters are intended to be transmitted to or from
    the host environment as a block when a new-line character is
    encountered. Furthermore, characters are intended to be transmitted as a
    block to the host environment when a buffer is filled, when input is
    requested on an unbuffered stream, or when input is requested on a line
    buffered stream that requires the transmission of characters from the host
    environment. Support for these characteristics is implementation-defined,
    and may be affected via the setbuf and setvbuf functions.</d:para>
    <d:para>A file may be disassociated from a controlling stream by
    <d:code>closing</d:code> the file. Output streams are flushed (any
    unwritten buffer contents are transmitted to the host environment) before
    the stream is disassociated from the file. The value of a pointer to a
    <d:code>FILE</d:code> object is indeterminate after the associated file is
    closed (including the standard text streams). Whether a file of zero length
    (on which no characters have been written by an output stream) actually
    exists is implementation-defined.</d:para>
    <d:para>The file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or another
    program execution, and its contents reclaimed or modified (if it can be
    repositioned at its start). If the <d:code>main</d:code> function returns
    to its original caller, or if the <d:code>exit</d:code> function is called,
    all open files are closed (hence all output streams are flushed) before
    program termination. Other paths to program termination, such as calling
    the abort function, need not close all files properly.</d:para>
    <d:para>The address of the <d:code>FILE</d:code> object used to control a
    stream may be significant; a copy of a <d:code>FILE</d:code> object need
    not serve in place of the original.</d:para>
    <d:para>At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not
    be opened explicitly - <d:emphasis role="italic">standard
    input</d:emphasis> (for reading conventional input), <d:emphasis
    role="italic">standard output</d:emphasis> (for writing conventional
    output) and standard error (for writing diagnostic output). As initially
    opened, the <d:emphasis role="italic">y</d:emphasis> stream is not fully
    buffered; the standard input and standard output streams are fully buffered
    if and only if the stream can be determined not to refer to an interactive
    device.</d:para>
    <d:para>Functions that open additional (nontemporary) files require a
    <d:emphasis role="italic">file name</d:emphasis>, which is a string. The
    rules for composing valid file names are implementation-defined. Whether
    the same file can be simultaneously open multiple times is also
    implementation-defined.</d:para>
    <d:para>Although both text and binary wide-oriented streams are
    conceptually sequences of wide characters, the external file associated
    with a wide-oriented stream is a sequence of multibyte characters,
    generalized as follows:</d:para>
    <d:itemizedlist>
      <d:listitem>
	<d:para>Multibyte encodings within files may contain embedded null
	bytes (unlike multibyte encodings valid for use internal to the
	program).</d:para>
      </d:listitem>
      <d:listitem>
	<d:para>A file need not begin nor end in the initial shift
	state.<d:footnote><d:para>Setting the file position indicator to
	end-of-file, as with <d:code>fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END)</d:code>, has
	undefined behavior for a binary stream (because of possible trailing
	null characters) or for any stream with state-dependent encoding that
	does not assuredly end in the initial shift
	state.</d:para></d:footnote></d:para>
      </d:listitem>
    </d:itemizedlist>
    <d:para>Moreover, the encodings used for multibyte characters may differ
    among files. Both the nature and choice of such encodings are
    implementation-defined.</d:para>
    <d:para>The wide character input functions read multibyte characters from
    the stream and convert them to wide characters as if they were read by
    successive calls to the <d:code>fgetwc</d:code> function. Each conversion
    occurs as if by a call to the <d:code>mbrtowc</d:code> function, with the
    conversion state described by the stream's own <d:code>mbstate_t</d:code>
    object. The byte input functions read characters from the stream as if by
    successive calls to the <d:code>fgetc</d:code> function.</d:para>
    <d:para>The wide character output functions convert wide characters to
    multibyte characters and write them to the stream as if they were written
    by successive calls to the <d:code>fputwc</d:code> function. Each
    conversion occurs as if by a call to the wcrtomb function, with the
    conversion state described by the stream's own <d:code>mbstate_t</d:code>
    object. The byte output functions write characters to the stream as if by
    successive calls to the <d:code>fputc</d:code> function.</d:para>
    <d:para>In some cases, some of the byte input/output functions also perform
    conversions between multibyte characters and wide characters. These
    conversions also occur as if by calls to the <d:code>mbrtowc</d:code> and
    <d:code>wcrtomb</d:code> functions.</d:para>
    <d:para>An <d:emphasis role="italic">encoding error</d:emphasis> occurs if
    the character sequence presented to the underlying <d:code>mbrtowc</d:code>
    function does not form a valid (generalized) multibyte character, or if the
    code value passed to the underlying <d:code>wcrtomb</d:code> does not
    correspond to a valid (generalized) multibyte character. The wide character
    input/output functions and the byte input/output functions store the value
    of the macro <d:code>EILSEQ</d:code> in errno if and only if an encoding
    error occurs.</d:para>
    <d:para><d:emphasis role="bold">Enviromental limits</d:emphasis></d:para>
    <d:para>The value of <d:code>FOPEN_MAX</d:code> shall be at least eight,
    including the three standard text streams.</d:para>
